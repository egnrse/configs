# The look and feel part of this hyprland config.
# The main-config file is `hyprland.conf`
#
# Refer to the hyprland wiki or the egnrse/.config git for more information.

# There are some very similar settings in `window-rules.conf`.
# If u want to set custom app/layer/workspace behaviours/looks, u will find them there.
